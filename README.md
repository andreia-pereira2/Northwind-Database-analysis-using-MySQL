# üìä Northwind Database SQL Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
For this project, I worked with the **Northwind database**, a classic dataset used for training SQL skills, but focusing on MySQL queries. This database contains sales data from a fictional company, including **customers, orders, products, employees, and suppliers**. It provides a great opportunity for data analysts to practice MySQL queries and database management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Techniques Used
- **Data retrieval** using `SELECT` statements
- **Filtering data** with `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, and `ORDER BY`
- **Aggregating data** using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
- **Joining tables** to analyze relationships within the dataset
- **Sorting and ordering** results for better insights

## üîç Queries & Analysis
Below are some of the SQL queries I executed and their insights:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Selecting Products in a Price Range
```sql
SELECT * FROM northwind.products
WHERE price BETWEEN 50 AND 100;
```
**Insight:** This query retrieves all products priced between $50 and $100, helping in price analysis for mid-range products.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieving Orders Between Specific Dates
```sql
SELECT * FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN "1996-01-01" AND "1996-12-31"
ORDER BY OrderDate;
```
**Insight:** Extracts all orders placed in 1996, useful for time-based sales analysis.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Filtering Order Details by Quantity
```sql
SELECT * FROM order_details
WHERE Quantity BETWEEN 5 AND 15
ORDER BY Quantity;
```
**Insight:** Helps identify moderate-quantity purchases, which might be the most common order sizes.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Selecting Customer Details
```sql
SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS Customer
FROM Customers;
```
**Insight:** Provides a simplified customer list for quick reference.

## üìä Visualizing Results
Below are images showing also the use of joint queries and results for better understanding:

```sql
select Orders.OrderID, Shippers.ShipperID, Shippers.ShipperName
from Orders
inner join Shippers
on Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID;
```
**Insight:** Find out shippers for different orders.

```sql
select Products.ProductName, Suppliers.SupplierName
from Suppliers
inner join Products
on Products.SupplierId = Suppliers.SupplierID;
```

**Insight:** Selects all products with thier suppliers.
